### **FAQs Section** (3-5 Required)

Each FAQ needs:
- **Question**: Natural language, how people actually search
- **Answer**: 2-3 sentences, factual, helpful

#### Example FAQs:

**Q: What is spiced rum made from?**
**A:** Spiced rum is made from a base of Caribbean rum (distilled from sugarcane or molasses) that's infused with a blend of spices and botanicals. Common spices include vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove, though each distillery uses its own proprietary blend. The base rum can be unaged or aged before spicing, depending on the desired flavor profile.

**Q: Is spiced rum the same as dark rum?**
**A:** No, spiced rum and dark rum are different categories. Dark rum gets its colour and flavor from aging in charred oak barrels, while spiced rum has added spices and botanicals regardless of aging. A spiced rum can be dark in colour, but that's usually from caramel colouring or aging, not from being a dark rum by classification.

**Q: How should I drink spiced rum?**
**A:** Quality spiced rum can be enjoyed neat, over ice, or in cocktails. For sipping, serve it neat in a rocks glass at room temperature to appreciate the spice complexity. It also works beautifully in classic rum cocktails like the Dark & Stormy or Rum Punch, where the spices add depth and warmth.

**Q: What makes UK craft spiced rum different?**
**A:** UK craft distilleries often bring innovation to traditional Caribbean rum by sourcing premium base spirits and creating unique spice blends with British botanicals. Many are small-batch operations run by passionate distillers who prioritize quality and experimentation over mass production, resulting in more complex and distinctive flavor profiles.

**Q: Does spiced rum contain added sugar?**
**A:** Many commercial spiced rums contain added sugar to create sweetness and smoothness, though the amount varies widely by brand. UK and European regulations don't require sugar content disclosure, but craft distilleries often minimize sugar additions to let the natural rum and spice flavors shine through. Check with individual producers if this matters to you.
