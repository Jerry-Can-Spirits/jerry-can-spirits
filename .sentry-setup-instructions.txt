SENTRY AUTH TOKEN SETUP
========================

Issue: Sentry source maps aren't being uploaded during builds (warnings in build log)

Why this matters:
- Without source maps, error stack traces in Sentry will show minified code
- Makes debugging production errors much harder
- You're already paying the build time cost without getting the benefit

How to Fix:
============

Step 1: Get Your Sentry Auth Token
-----------------------------------
IMPORTANT: You need an ORGANIZATION token (not a personal token)!

1. Go to: https://sentry.io/settings/jerry-can-spirits/auth-tokens/
   (Organization Settings → Developer Settings → Auth Tokens)

2. Click "Create New Token"

3. Configure the token:
   - Name: "Cloudflare Pages Build"
   - Scopes: org:ci (automatically selected - this is the ONLY scope for org tokens)
     - Includes: Source Map Upload + Release Creation

4. Click "Create Token"

5. Copy the generated token immediately (you'll only see it once!)

Note: Organization tokens are simpler than personal tokens:
- Only one scope: org:ci (auto-selected)
- Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
- Won't break if team members change

Step 2: Add to Local Development (.env.local)
----------------------------------------------
Add this line to your .env.local file:

SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token-here

Step 3: Add to Cloudflare Pages
--------------------------------
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Pages → jerry-can-spirits → Settings → Environment variables
3. Add variable:
   - Name: SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
   - Value: [paste your token]
   - Environment: Production (and Preview if you want)
4. Save and redeploy

Step 4: Verify
--------------
After the next build, you should see in the build logs:
✅ "Uploading source maps to Sentry" (instead of warnings)

Alternative: Disable Sentry Source Maps
========================================
If you don't want to use Sentry source maps, you can disable the warnings by:

1. Editing next.config.ts
2. In the withSentryConfig call, add:
   silent: true,  // This already exists, just keep it

   Or remove Sentry entirely if not using error tracking.

Current Status:
- Sentry DSN is configured ✓
- Error tracking IS working ✓
- Source maps NOT uploading ✗ (needs auth token)
