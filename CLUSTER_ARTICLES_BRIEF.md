### FAQs

**Q: Can dark rum be spiced?**
**A:** Yes, some rums are both dark (aged in oak barrels) and spiced (infused with botanicals). These "aged spiced rums" combine the smoothness and complexity from barrel aging with the aromatic character of spice additions, offering depth that neither category achieves alone.

**Q: Is Captain Morgan dark rum or spiced rum?**
**A:** [SKIP THIS FAQ - avoid mentioning mass-market brands. Replace with:]

**Q: Does spiced rum have to be dark in colour?**
**A:** No, spiced rum doesn't have to be dark. While many spiced rums appear dark brown, this comes from added caramel colour, barrel aging, or the base rum used—not from the spices themselves. Some craft distillers produce lighter-coloured spiced rums that showcase the spices without heavy colouring.

**Q: Which is stronger, dark rum or spiced rum?**
**A:** Neither category is inherently stronger—both typically sit at 40% ABV (alcohol by volume), the standard for spirits. However, you'll find overproof versions in both categories that exceed 50% ABV. Strength depends on the specific product, not the category.

**Q: Can you make rum in the UK?**

### FAQs

**Q: What is the main spice in spiced rum?**
**A:** Vanilla is the most common primary spice in spiced rum, providing sweetness, creaminess, and warmth that forms the foundation of most blends. However, quality spiced rums balance vanilla with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and other botanicals to create complexity rather than relying on a single dominant spice.

**Q: Are the spices in spiced rum natural?**
**A:** This varies by producer. Craft distillers typically use natural whole spices macerated in the rum, while some commercial brands use spice extracts or artificial flavourings for consistency and cost efficiency. UK craft producers generally emphasise natural spice blends—check labels or contact distillers directly if this matters to you.

**Q: Can I make my own spiced rum?**
**A:** Yes, you can infuse white or aged rum with whole spices at home. Start with quality rum, add whole spices (vanilla bean, cinnamon stick, nutmeg, clove, allspice) to a sealed jar, and let macerate for 5-7 days, tasting daily. Strain and add simple syrup if desired. However, replicating the balance of professional blends takes experimentation and expertise.

### FAQs

**Q: Should you drink spiced rum straight?**

**Q: What is the best mixer for spiced rum?**
**A:** Ginger beer is the classic pairing, creating the iconic Dark & Stormy, but spiced rum works beautifully with cola, apple juice, pineapple juice, or even tonic water. The best mixer depends on the rum's spice profile—vanilla-forward rums pair with cola, while ginger and cinnamon-heavy rums shine with ginger beer or apple cider.

**Q: Is spiced rum good for cocktails?**
**A:** Yes, spiced rum is exceptional in cocktails. Its spice complexity adds depth to classic rum drinks and creates warming, aromatic serves perfect for autumn and winter. It works in everything from simple highballs to sophisticated stirred cocktails, often replacing whiskey or bourbon in classics like the Old Fashioned.

**A:** For enthusiasts who appreciate complexity, quality ingredients, and supporting small businesses, craft spiced rum offers value beyond price.
