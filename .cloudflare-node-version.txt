CLOUDFLARE PAGES NODE.JS VERSION FIX
=====================================

Issue: Cloudflare Pages is using Node.js 20.19.2 instead of Node.js 22

Fix Instructions:
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Select your account → Pages → jerry-can-spirits project
3. Go to Settings → Environment variables
4. Add a new environment variable:
   - Variable name: NODE_VERSION
   - Value: 22.11.0
   - Environment: Production (and Preview if desired)
5. Click "Save"
6. Redeploy your site

Alternative:
- The .nvmrc and .node-version files should work, but Cloudflare sometimes needs the explicit environment variable.

Why this matters:
- Node.js 20 is in maintenance mode and approaching end-of-life
- Your package.json requires Node >= 22.0.0
- Node 22 has better performance and security
