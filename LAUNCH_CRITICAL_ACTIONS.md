# Launch Critical Actions - Priority Order

Based on your meeting notes. Since you're working day shifts, this is organized by priority and time needed.

## üö® MUST FIX BEFORE LAUNCH (Critical Bugs)

### 1. **Klaviyo Signup Not Working** ‚è±Ô∏è 30 mins
**Issue:** Rhys's signup didn't appear in Klaviyo

**Likely Causes:**
- Dev environment may not have `KLAVIYO_PRIVATE_KEY` set
- Or it's pointing to a test/sandbox Klaviyo account

**Fix:**
1. Check `.env.local` has `KLAVIYO_PRIVATE_KEY=your_key_here`
2. Test signup on production site (not dev) after launch
3. If still broken, I'll help debug the API calls

**Action:** Test after turning off Cloudflare wall. If broken, ping me immediately.
